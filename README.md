David Kramer's dotfiles

Contains my personal configuration that I use between my various unix machines.
I'm biased and like my setup, but you might find some cool trickery hidden in here.

My biggest thing in here is my vimrc, which has seen many iterations and I continue to
change all the time as I discover new things to fit my needs. But you'll also find a nice
setup for tmux, and zsh (using oh-my-zsh).

I do have an installation script to symlink all *rc files while preserving any existing ones.
The script will prompt you to confirm if you want to symlink or not. However, I currently don't
have a revert script to do the opposite. Perhaps I'll add later, but since this is mainly for me,
I know that I always want the latest that's here!

Script has worked on macOS, as well as debian based systems. I have also had success installing on
android w/ the termux (terminal emulator) application.

If you decide to use, I take no responsibility for any erroneous results. However, nothing catastrophic
should happen :)
